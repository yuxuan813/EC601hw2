iOS develop:
I use swift to write a tutorial foodtracker software, which shows a list of meals, including a meal name, rating, and photo. A user can add a new meal, and remove or edit an existing meal. To add a new meal or edit an existing one, users navigate to a different screen where they can specify a name, rating, and photo for a particular meal.
